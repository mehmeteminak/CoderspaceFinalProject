# coderspace-final-project

This project is final project for Coderspace Pazarama iOS bootcamp. I used OMDB api in this project which is popular movie api.
I used UIKit programatically , MVVVM architectural design pattern , protocol oriented programming approach in this project. 
And all views and view controllers are designed responsive.I also used Kingfisher library for the image loading and caching.
And i wrote some unit test functions for the ensuring functions are working like expected.
And here are the some screenshots.
