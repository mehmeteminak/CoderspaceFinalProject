# coderspace-final-project

This project is final project for Coderspace Pazarama iOS bootcamp.<br/>I used OMDB api in this project which is popular movie api.<br/>
I used UIKit programatically , MVVVM architectural design pattern , protocol oriented programming approach in this project. <br/>
And all views and view controllers are designed responsive.I also used Kingfisher library for the image loading and caching.<br/>
And i wrote some unit test functions for the ensuring functions are working like expected.<br/>
And here are the some screenshots.<br/><br/><br/>
